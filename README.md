# Python vs Java: Which one is Better for You?
You've probably found this essay because you cannot decide which Programming Language to use, but you have come to the right place. This essay will contain the Advantages and Disadvantages of Python and Java and help you decide which one is better for you.

  Let's start with Python. Python is an interpreted (Translated) Programming language with a Developer base of approximately 8.2 Million Developers. A few advantages of Python are that Python is Easy to Read and Understand, it's for Beginners who are new to Programming, and Its Programming Syntax is not as strict as Javas.  Python is great, but it also has its Disadvantages. These Disadvantages include not running as fast as other Programming Languages and that it isn't a very Professional Programming Language. Even though It's not Professional, I think that Python is Still a great Programming Language to use for how Straght-Forward it is and how it takes less time to write Python than in Java, even though it runs a bit slower.

  Now let's talk about Java. Java is a Compiled (Directly Run) Programming Language with a User Base of 9 Million Developers. A few advantages of Java are that it's a Professional Programming Language, and it's easier to Debug. (Fix Errors) Java also has its Disadvantages, being Harder to Learn than Python and Using more Computer Resources. I think that even though Java is Harder to learn, Java has more functions to help you than Python. It may take a bit longer to write, but it still runs faster and is a Professional Language.

# So, Which one Should I use?
That Depends on what you are trying to do and your ability.
If you need something done quickly, use Python, as It's easier to write and Understand. If you need the code to run Fast, like process a lot of information, use Java. It may take longer to write, but Java can handle Data better than Python can. Before you decide, think about the future of what your script might need to undertake. For example, if you were writing code that connects to the web that receives requests, you would probably want to use Java because if you receive too many requests in Python, it will start lagging in the future. That is why it's a good idea to think ahead, to understand what your code might undertake in the future.

# Conclusion

Overall, I would say that Python is better for Beginners and Java is Better for Intermediate and Advanced Developers. The reason for this is because Python really isn't really a Professional Language, as it is for beginners in programming, as for Java, it runs faster and is better for intermediate and advanced developers. (Although really, to Advanced Developers I would actually suggest C or C++.)
